I began my academic journey in the natural sciences, completing a B.Sc in Chemistry at Government College Chittur, Palakkad, in 2016. However, my academic interests took an unexpected yet intellectually rewarding turn when I developed a keen interest in language and linguistics.\r\nI went on to pursue an M.A.¬†in Linguistics at the Department of Linguistics, University of Kerala and completed the programme in 2020. Immediately after, I continued with an M.Phil. in Linguistics at the same department. During these years, I had the opportunity to work in the department‚Äôs Phonetics Laboratory, where I gained practical experience in speech analysis.\r\nInitially, my research focused on qualitative aspects of language. However, I soon became aware of the critical gaps in phonetic studies in Malayalam, a Dravidian language and my mother tongue. This realization led me to shift my focus toward experimental phonetics and phonology, with an aim to contribute to the systematic and empirical study of underrepresented languages.\r\nTo further strengthen my research and analytical skills, I joined the MSc in Forensic Phonetics programme at the Department of Language and Linguistic Science, University of York, UK, in 2022.\r\nResearch Interests\r\nAs an enthusiastic researcher with a strong background in Phonetology (i.e., phonetics and phonology), I am deeply interested in exploring both the abstract and physical properties of speech sounds, as well as their practical applications in fields such as forensic speaker analysis and automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology.\r\nAreas of Interest\r\nI am particularly interested in investigating speech sound variation within the following frameworks:\r\nAcoustic and Articulatory Phonetics\r\nSociophonetics and Forensic Phonetics\r\nCognitive Phonetics and Phonology\r\nTheoretical and Laboratory Phonology\r\nSpeech Synthesis and Speech Processing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
