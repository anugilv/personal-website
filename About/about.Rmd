## Bio

My name is **Anugil Velayudhan**, and I am from *Palakkad, Kerala, India*. I began my academic journey in the natural sciences, completing a **B.Sc in Chemistry** at *Government College Chittur, Palakkad*, in **2016**. However, my academic interests took an unexpected yet intellectually rewarding turn when I developed a keen interest in language and linguistics.

I went on to pursue an **M.A. in Linguistics** at the *Department of Linguistics, University of Kerala* and completed the programme in **2020**. Immediately after, I continued with an **M.Phil. in Linguistics** at the same department. During these years, I had the opportunity to work in the departmentâ€™s **Phonetics Laboratory**, where I gained practical experience in **speech analysis**.

Initially, my research focused on qualitative aspects of language. However, I soon became aware of the critical gaps in phonetic studies in Malayalam, a Dravidian language and my mother tongue. This realization led me to shift my focus toward **experimental phonetics and phonology**, with an aim to contribute to the systematic and empirical study of underrepresented languages. 

To further strengthen my research and analytical skills, I joined the **MSc in Forensic Phonetics** programme at the *Department of Language and Linguistic Science, University of York, UK*, in **2022**.

## Research Interests

As an enthusiastic researcher with a strong background in **Phonetology** (i.e., phonetics and phonology), I am deeply interested in exploring both the **abstract** and **physical properties** of speech sounds, as well as their **practical applications** in fields such as **forensic speaker analysis** and **automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology**.

### Areas of Interest

I am particularly interested in investigating speech sound variation within the following frameworks:

- **Acoustic and Articulatory Phonetics**
- **Sociophonetics and Forensic Phonetics**
- **Cognitive Phonetics and Phonology**
- **Theoretical and Laboratory Phonology**
- **Speech Synthesis and Speech Processing**
